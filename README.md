# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data (Twitter)

<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
Conceptualized and developed a sentiment analysis model to quantify the positivity of tweets across diverse geographic regions. Leveraged advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including count vectorization, TF-IDF, and Doc2Vec, to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.

<h3><strong>Key Concepts</strong></h3>

Data Handling and Pre-processing<br>
> - Data Cleaning: Processed unstructured text data to handle missing values and duplicates.
> - Feature Engineering: Utilized count vectorization, TF-IDF, and Doc2Vec to create meaningful features from raw text data.
> - Data Visualization: Used libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize sentiment distribution across regions.

Machine Learning Algorithms<br>
> - Supervised Learning: Trained the model using supervised learning techniques on labeled tweet data.
> - Unsupervised Learning: Applied clustering methods to explore patterns in sentiment data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)<br>
> - Text Pre-processing: Implemented tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization using NLTK.
> - NLP Models: Leveraged advanced models like Doc2Vec for feature extraction.
> - Libraries: Utilized NLTK and Gensim for various NLP tasks.

Model Evaluation and Validation<br>
> - Metrics: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
> - Cross-Validation: Conducted k-fold cross-validation to validate model stability.
